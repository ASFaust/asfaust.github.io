# Rooting the Nothing Phone (1) and Uninstalling System Apps

## ⚠️ Warning: Data Reset and 2FA Considerations

- **Rooting your phone** will likely trigger a factory reset, which means all data on your device will be erased, including apps, photos, messages, and settings. Ensure you have a full backup of your data before proceeding.
- **2-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: After rooting, you may face issues with signing back into your Google account if SMS 2FA is not working. In my case, SMS-based 2FA did not work, and I was unable to use it to log in. 
  - **Important**: It is strongly recommended to activate **backup codes** for your Google account’s 2FA before proceeding with the rooting process. These backup codes will allow you to sign in even if SMS 2FA is unavailable. You can generate backup codes from your Google Account settings under **Security > 2-Step Verification > Backup Codes**.

Proceed with caution and make sure you have both backups of your data and alternate 2FA methods ready before rooting your device.

## Prerequisites
1. **ADB & Fastboot**: Install ADB and Fastboot on your computer.
   - On Ubuntu: 
     ```bash
     sudo apt install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
     ```
   - On Windows, install [ADB & Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) tools.
2. **Magisk**: Download the latest version of Magisk from [here](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases).
3. **USB Debugging**: Enable USB debugging on your Nothing Phone (1).
   - Go to **Settings > About Phone**, and tap **Build Number** 7 times to enable Developer Options.
   - Go to **Settings > System > Developer Options** and turn on **USB Debugging**.

## Step 1: Download OTA and Extract Boot Image
1. Download the full OTA package corresponding to your current software version.
   - Capture the OTA download URL using ADB:
     ```bash
     adb logcat > ota_log.txt
     ```
   - When the OTA download begins, find the URL in `ota_log.txt` and download it using `wget` or your browser.

2. Extract the `boot.img`:
   - Unzip the downloaded OTA package:
     ```bash
     unzip package_name.zip
     ```
   - Extract `boot.img` from the `payload.bin` using the `payload-dumper-go` tool:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go
     cd payload-dumper-go
     go build
     ./payload-dumper-go /path/to/payload.bin
     ```
   - The `boot.img` will be in the output directory.

## Step 2: Patch the Boot Image with Magisk
1. Copy the extracted `boot.img` to your phone.
2. Open the **Magisk** app and select **Install**.
3. Tap **Select and Patch a File**, and choose the `boot.img`.
4. Magisk will create a patched image (e.g., `magisk_patched.img`). Copy this patched image back to your computer.

## Step 3: Flash the Patched Boot Image
1. Reboot your phone into **Fastboot Mode**:
   - Using ADB:
     ```bash
     adb reboot bootloader
     ```
   - Or manually by powering off the device, then holding the **Volume Down** + **Power** buttons.

2. Flash the patched boot image using fastboot:
   ```bash
   fastboot flash boot /path/to/magisk_patched.img
   fastboot reboot
